## About the Project

This is a **Hotel Reservation System** developed as an academic project using **Laravel (PHP framework)**, **MySQL**, and **Python**. It offers a user-friendly interface for customers to:

- Browse and view available rooms
- Make bookings (with or without login)
- Receive room recommendations based on selected amenities using **Cosine Similarity**

Admins have access to a dashboard for managing rooms, bookings, gallery, and other content.

Python integration is done using a standalone script located in the Laravel `storage/app/python/` directory. Views are built using Laravel Blade templates, separated for admin and user roles.
